2025 has been a weird year in my life. Everything is more or less the same in terms of routine. Im studing at college, and i will be doing so until 2027.

The important thing is that this year meant for me a mental shift, a necessary mental shift from what I have been doing.

You know how social media constantly shoves that "perfect life" down your throat? A digital garden is basically the opposite of all that. It's _your_ corner of the internet, a personal space that's always growing and changing, just like you are. Think of it as a quiet rebellion, a real act of self-care. Instead of trying to put on a show for everyone, you're just gently cultivating your own thoughts and ideas, even the messy, half-baked ones. It's all about your mental well-being, totally free from that ridiculous pressure to perform and all the sneaky ways corporations try to manipulate you online.
