# Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)

The capacity to "harness the full potential of what you know" indicates that PKM shifts individuals from a reactive mode of information searching to a proactive stance of knowledge application, thereby improving the quality and speed of their intellectual output.






# Second Brain
the more one expresses and applies knowledge, the more one learns, refines, and expands the captured knowledge, leading to a richer and more effective "Second Brain."
