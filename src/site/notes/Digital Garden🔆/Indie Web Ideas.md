Im thinking of creating my own indie website, where I write about me and express myself, i want creativity.

The difference between an Indie Web and my [[Digital GardenğŸ”†/Jean - Digital Garden Home\|Jean - Digital Garden Home]], to me atleast, is that

* The digital garden is a set of notes, ideas and [[Digital GardenğŸ”†/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] I can share publicly, its like a public learning space.
* The indie web is more like a [[Digital GardenğŸ”†/Creativity\|Creativity]] space where I share things about me and all things i wish to share, is more broad and general.
