This is the very first text to ever be written here, yea

[[Digital GardenðŸ”†/Why did I even started this\|Why did I even started this]]

I think the idea of a Digital Garden resonates with the idea of [[Digital GardenðŸ”†/PKM and the Second Brain\|PKM and the Second Brain]] but taken to a more public matter. Sharing knowledge and not only that, I think it highlights a more natural way of presenting yourself on the internet, your thoughts, and your personal growth. Rather than the systematic "perfect life" people tend to unconsciously present on social media.

This page itself its not perfect, and I don't know what *perfect* means anymore. But the important thing is that, it doesn't matter, because it will naturally evolve, and improve, like we all do.
