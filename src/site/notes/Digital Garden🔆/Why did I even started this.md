2025 has been a weird year in my life. Everything is more or less the same in terms of routine. Im studing at college, and i will be doing so until 2027.

The important thing is that this year meant for me a mental shift, a necessary mental shift from what I have been doing.

Imagine an online space that's truly yours, where the pressure to show a 'perfect' life simply doesn't exist. A **digital garden** is that place: a personal, evolving haven where you can cultivate your thoughts and ideas, without judgment. It's a gentle rebellion against the relentless performance of social media, designed to nurture your mental well-being and free your mind from the grip of corporate algorithms. 

Here, imperfection is celebrated, and ideas are allowed to grow, just like in a real garden.
